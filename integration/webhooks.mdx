description: 'Listen to events on your resources with webhooks.'
---

## Overview
When integrating the Vatis Streams API you may need to listen to events on your resources, so your application can react accordingly.
To do this, you can register a webhook endpoint containing the URL where you want to receive the events and the type of events the endpoint is listening to.
When an event is triggered, a `POST` request will be sent to all the registered endpoints with the event data.

## Setup

Manage your webhooks through the [API Dashboard](https://vatis.tech/app/playground/webhooks).

## Webhook structure

The webhook endpoint you can define will have the following structure:
```json
{
  "id": "<string>",
  "url": "<string>",
  "events": [
    "<string>"
  ],
  "enabled": true,
  "description": "<string>"
}
```

| Property      | Description                                                                                                             |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`          | The webhook endpoint identifier                                                                                         |
| `url`         | The URL where the events will be sent. Accepted protocols: `HTTP`, `HTTPS`                                              |
| `events`      | The list of event types the endpoint is listening to. Check the avaiable event types [here](#event-types)               |
| `enabled`     | Indicates if the webhook is enabled. You can disable an endpoint to temporarily stop receiving requests to the endpoint |
| `description` | An optional description of the webhook                                                                                  |

<Warning>Local IP addresses and loopback interfaces are not allowed in the `url`</Warning>

## Event structure

The webhook event you'll receive will have the following structure:
```json
{
  "id": "<string>",
  "type": "<string>",
  "webhookEndpointId": "<string>",
  "timestamp": "<long>",
  "payloadSchema": "<string>",
  "payload": "<object>"
}
```

| Property            | Description                                                                         |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`                | The event identifier                                                                |
| `type`              | The event type. Check the avaiable event types [here](#event-types)                 |
| `webhookEndpointId` | The webhook endpoint identifier                                                     |
| `timestamp`         | The event timestamp in milliseconds since epoch. Use this to prevent replay attacks |
| `payloadSchema`     | The fully qualified name of the payload schema                                      |
| `payload`           | The event payload                                                                   |

## Source IPs

To make sure your server is able to receive the events, you can **whitelist** the following IP addresses:
- `18.194.212.83`
- `3.120.9.38`
- `3.68.55.77`

## Redelivery

If the server does not respond with a `2xx` status code, the event redelivery will be retried for the next three hours with an exponential backoff strategy.

## Development

For experimenting the webhook integration on a local environment, you can create the setup described below.

## Considerations

1. A user can define up to 20 webhook endpoints
2. The same event may be sent multiple times to the same endpoint
3. The order of the events is not guaranteed
