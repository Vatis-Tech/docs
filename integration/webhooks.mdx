description: 'Listen to events on your resources with webhooks.'

## Overview
When integrating the Vatis Streams API you may need to listen to events on your resources, so your application can react accordingly.
To do this, you can register a webhook endpoint containing the URL where you want to receive the events and the type of events the endpoint is listening to.
When an event is triggered, a `POST` request will be sent to all the registered endpoints with the event data.

## Setup

Manage your webhooks through the [API Dashboard](https://vatis.tech/app/playground/webhooks).

## Webhook structure

The webhook endpoint you can define will have the following structure:
```json
{
  "id": "<string>",
  "url": "<string>",
  "events": [
    "<string>"
  ],
  "enabled": true,
  "description": "<string>"
}
```

| Property      | Description                                                                                                             |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`          | The webhook endpoint identifier                                                                                         |
| `url`         | The URL where the events will be sent. Accepted protocols: `HTTP`, `HTTPS`                                              |
| `events`      | The list of event types the endpoint is listening to. Check the avaiable event types [here](#event-types)               |
| `enabled`     | Indicates if the webhook is enabled. You can disable an endpoint to temporarily stop receiving requests to the endpoint |
| `description` | An optional description of the webhook                                                                                  |

<Warning>Local IP addresses and loopback interfaces are not allowed in the `url`</Warning>

## Event structure

The webhook event you'll receive will have the following structure:
```json
{
  "id": "<string>",
  "type": "<string>",
  "webhookEndpointId": "<string>",
  "timestamp": "<long>",
  "payloadSchema": "<string>",
  "payload": "<object>"
}
```

|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`                | The event identifier                                                                |
| `type`              | The event type. Check the avaiable event types [here](#event-types)                 |
| `webhookEndpointId` | The webhook endpoint identifier                                                     |
| `timestamp`         | The event timestamp in milliseconds since epoch. Use this to prevent replay attacks |
| `payloadSchema`     | The fully qualified name of the payload schema                                      |
| `payload`           | The event payload                                                                   |

## Source IPs

To make sure your server is able to receive the events, you can **whitelist** the following IP addresses:
- `Europe`: `52.59.67.134`

## Redelivery

If the server does not respond with a `2xx` status code, the event redelivery will be retried for the next three hours with an exponential backoff strategy.

## Development

For experimenting the webhook integration on a local environment, you can create the setup described below.

## Considerations

1. A user can define up to 20 webhook endpoints
2. The same event may be sent multiple times to the same endpoint
3. The order of the events is not guaranteed

## Dynamic webhooks

A dynamic webhook is a webhook defined on a resource basis. In contrast to a standard webhook that is defined once and can be triggered by any resource (group, stream, gateway, etc.) based on the event key,
a dynamic webhook is associated with a specific resource and it can be triggered only by that resource.

The main advantage of a dynamic webhook is the ability to modify the endpoint URL for each created stream. For example, we can include a unique identifier in the endpoint URL that changes for each created stream.

### All gateways

For each available gateway, a dynamic webhook can be defined as a query parameter that follows this general syntax: `webhook[.RESOURCE[.STATE]]=<url>`

For example:
- `webhook.stream.completed=https://mydomain.com/success` will create a dynamic webhook the receives the `stream.completed` event at the `https://mydomain.com/success` URL
- `webhook.stream.completed=https://mydomain.com/success&webhook.stream.failed=https://mydomain.com/fail` will create two dynamic webhooks, one that will be triggered by the `stream.completed` event at the `https://mydomain.com/success` URL,
    and the other that will receive the `stream.failed` event at the `https://mydomain.com/fail` URL
- `webhook.stream.completed=https://mydomain.com/status&webhook.stream.failed=https://mydomain.com/status` will create a single dynamic webhook that will be triggered by both `stream.completed` and `stream.failed` events
    at the `https://mydomain.com/status` URL
- `webhook.stream=https://mydomain.com/stream-event` is a wildcard dynamic webhook that be triggered by any stream-related event at the `https://mydomain.com/stream-event` URL
- `webhook=https://mydomain.com/any-event` is a wildcard dynamic webhook that will be triggered by any event at the `https://mydomain.com/any-event` URL

### Websocket Gateway

Additionally to the dynamic webhooks defined using query parameter, the `WebSocket Gateway` can receive the dynamic webhooks configuration using the [Configuration Message](/integration/websocket#configuration).

The general form of the webhook configuration is as follows:

```json
{
  "type": "CONFIGURATION",
  "webhook": {
    "https://mydomain.com/success": ["stream.completed"],
    "https://mydomain.com/fail": ["stream.failed"],
    "https://mydomain.com/status": ["stream.completed", "stream.failed"],
    "https://mydomain.com/stream-event": ["stream.*"],
    "https://mydomain.com/any-event": ["*"]
  }
}
```

<Warning>Please use either the query parameters or the configuration message for defining the dynamic webhooks. If both are specified, the behaviour is undefined.</Warning>

### Limitations

- Only `stream` and `group` resources can be used in dynamic webhooks
- No more than 3 dynamic wehooks can be defined
- The supported endpoint protocols are `http` and `https`
