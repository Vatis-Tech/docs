description: 'Perform real-time operations with Vatis Streams websocket API'
---

## Overview
Websocket API comes as an alternative to the integration of the ingress (via `HTTP Gateway`) and the egress connection (via `Egress Service`) that combines the two in a single, easier to manage, connection.

The connection is managed by the `WS Gateway` component and it can be used as a bot ingress and egress connection, or only as an ingress connection.
The `Egress Service` can be used along side with the `WS Gateway` to retrieve the results of the websocket-initiated stream from multiple clients.

</Accordion>


## Authentication
A client can authenticate to the websocket API by providing either a `Basic` or a `Bearer` token. The token can be placed in either the `Authorization` or `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` headers.
- `Authorization: Basic <basic_token>`
- `Authorization: Bearer <basic_token>`

### Basic token
The basic token is a base64 encoded string of the `username:password` pair. The `username` is the `client_id` and the `password` is the `client_secret`.

### Bearer token
Generate a bearer token using the [authentication endpoint](/api-reference/commons/authenticate).
<Tip>Use this authentication method when the token will reach a front channel (e.g. website)</Tip>


## Configuration
The stream configuration options will be passed as query parameters to the websocket connection URL.

For more details, please check the [WS Gateway API Reference](/api-reference/introduction.mdx) and the properties of the stream configuration template you're planning to use.

## Stream metadata
Right after the client connects, and attempt to create the stream is made. If successful, a `stream metadata` message will be sent to the client.
Otherwise, an error will be emitted and the connection will be closed.

        S->>C: Error on stream creation

        S-->>C: Normal connection close
  ```
</Accordion>

## Timeouts
Generally the client will continuously send messages to the server, but there are scenarios where the client will stay idle (e.g. waiting for a new chunk of data to send or waiting for the end of stream signal).<br/>
The websocket connection will be closed after **10 seconds of inactivity**. We define the period inactivity as the time elapsed since the last message was sent by the client.

To prevent the connection to close, the client has two options:
- send a `KeepAlive message` when the client becomes idle
- send a `Ping message` to the server. This will trigger a `Pong message` from the server

In this case the connection will become idle. We define the idle period as the time elapsed since the last non-keep-alive message was sent by the client.

<Info>Idle connections will timeout after 30 minutes</Info>
<Info>Timeout connections will be closed without any error message or signal</Info>
<Tip>Use the `ping-pong` mechanism if the library provides it. Set the ping interval to `5 seconds`</Tip>

        S-->>C: Normal connection close
    ```
</Accordion>

## End of stream

After the client has sent all the data, it must signal this by sending an `End of stream` message.
If the client is waiting for all responses, it must wait for the `End of stream` message from the server.
After sending the `End of stream` message, the server will immediately close the connection.

<Info>A client disconnect will trigger the end of stream signal</Info>
<Info>The server will emit an End of Stream signal only if the websocket connection is also used as egress</Info>

</Accordion>

## Error handling

The server will emit an error message if the client sends an invalid message or if the server encounters an error while processing the message.
The connection will be closed by the server immediately after sending the error message.

<Info>Whether an error occurs or not, the connection will be closed with a `1000 - Normal Closure` code</Info>
