            <Step title='Get client credentials'>
                Get the `Client Id` and `Client Secret` from your Vatis Tech Platform account
            </Step>
            <Step title="Set the client credentials">
                There are two ways to set the client credentials on each request:
                1. Set the `X-Client-Id` and `X-Client-Secret` as headers
                2. Set the `client_id` and `client_secret` as query parameters

                <Warning>Send the credentials as query parameters with extra caution as they may get logged</Warning>
            </Step>

        <Steps>
            <Step title='Get client credentials'>
                Get the `Client Id` and `Client Secret` from your Vatis Tech Platform account
            </Step>
             <Step title='Exchange for access token'>
                Send a `POST` request with the following parameters:

                 ```json
                 {
                    "grant_type": "client_credentials",
                    "client_id": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
                    "client_secret": "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"
                 }
                 ```
                <Note>The actual request will be shown in the workflows</Note>
            </Step>
            <Step title='Extract the access token'>
                In the response, you will get an `access_token` which you can use to authenticate your requests.

                ```json
                {
                    "access_token": "eyJhb...",
                    "expires_in": 600,
                    "token_type": "Bearer",
                    ...
                }
                ```
                <Warning>It's recommended to obtain a new access token before each workflow execution</Warning>
            </Step>
            <Step title="Set the authorization token">
                There are two ways to set the authorization token on each subsequent request:
                1. Set the `Authorization` header with the `Bearer [token]` value
                2. Set the `access_token` as a query parameter having the token as the value

                <Note>It's recommended to set the token as a header</Note>
            </Step>
