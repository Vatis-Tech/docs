The Vatis Streams API offers the following authentication schemas:
- **Client credentials**: Authenticate using the `Client Id` and `Client Secret` provided by Vatis Tech Platform
- **Authorization token**: Authenticate using an `access_token` obtained by exchanging the client credentials
- **API Key**: Authenticate using an `api key` provided by Vatis Tech Platform

        <Steps>
            <Step title='Get client credentials'>
                Get the `Client Id` and `Client Secret` from your [API Dashboard](https://vatis.tech/app/playground/transcribe)
            </Step>
            <Step title="Set the client credentials">
                There are two ways to set the client credentials on each request:
                1. Set the `X-Client-Id` and `X-Client-Secret` headers
                2. Set the `client_id` and `client_secret` query parameters

                <Warning>Send the credentials as query parameters with extra caution as they may get logged</Warning>
            </Step>

    <Tab title="Authorization token">
        <Steps>
            <Step title='Get client credentials'>
                Get the `Client Id` and `Client Secret` from your Vatis Tech Platform account
            </Step>
             <Step title='Exchange credentials for access token'>
                Request the access token as illustrated below:

                ```bash
                 curl --request POST \
                  --url https://auth.vatis.tech/realms/vatistech/protocol/openid-connect/token \
                  --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
                  --data 'client_id=string' \
                  --data 'client_secret=string' \
                  --data grant_type=client_credentials
                ```

            <Step title='Extract the access token'>
                In the response, you will get an `access_token` which you can use to authenticate your requests.

                ```json
                {
                    "access_token": "eyJhb...",
                    "expires_in": 600,
                    "token_type": "Bearer",
                    ...
                }
                ```
                <Warning>It's recommended to obtain a new access token before each workflow execution</Warning>
            </Step>
            <Step title="Set the authorization token">
                There are two ways to set the authorization token on each subsequent request:
                1. Set the `Authorization` header with the `Bearer [token]` value
                2. Set the `access_token` as a query parameter having the token as the value

                <Note>It's recommended to set the token as a header</Note>

            </Step>
            <Step title="Set the API key">
                There are two ways to set the API key on each subsequent request:
                1. Set the `Authorization` header with the `Basic [api_key]` value
                2. Set the `access_token` as a query parameter having the API key as the value

                <Warning>Send the API key as query parameter with extra caution as it may get logged</Warning>
