<Steps>
    <Step title='Get client credentials'>
        Get the `Client Id` and `Client Secret` from your Vatis Tech Platform account
    </Step>
     <Step title='Exchange for access token'>
        Send a `POST` request with the following parameters:

         ```json
         {
            "grant_type": "client_credentials",
            "client_id": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
            "client_secret": "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"
         }
         ```
        <Note>The actual request will be shown in the workflows</Note>
    </Step>
    <Step title='Extract the access token'>
        In the response, you will get an `access_token` which you can use to authenticate your requests.

        ```json
        {
            "access_token": "eyJhb...",
            "expires_in": 600,
            "token_type": "Bearer",
            ...
        }
        ```
        <Warning>It's recommended to obtain a new access token before each workflow execution</Warning>
    </Step>
</Steps>
