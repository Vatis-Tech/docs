## Overview

A stream error is a signal that something went wrong in the stream. It can occur in one of the following stream stages:
- during stream creation
- during stream processing

In this guide, you will learn how to inspect errors in a stream based on the stage it occurred.

## Stream creation errors

A stream creation error is an error that can be determined ahead of time, before the stream starts processing. It can occur due to various reasons, such as:
- invalid stream configuration
- maximum number of concurrent streams reached
- insufficient compute capacity
- authn or authz errors

The stream creation error may occur only in the upload phase, and it will result in a non-2xx HTTP status code.

The response body will be a standard [Error Response](/api-reference/schemas/error/error-response) JSON object, which can look like this:
```json
{
  "statusCode": 400,
  "title": "Invalid stream configuration",
  "message": "Forbidden patch: /langs",
  "internalErrorName": "STREAM_CONFIGURATION_BAD_PATCH",
  "nestedErrors": []
}
```

## Stream processing errors

A stream processing error is an asynchronous error that occurs during the stream processing phase due to request data processing problems. It can occur due to various reasons, such as:
- invalid or missing request data
- unsupported payload type
- payload too large

An asynchronous error will cause the stream to enter in the `FAILED` state, and it can be identified either by regularly polling the [stream state](/api-reference/streams/stream-resource-impl/find-by-id) or receiving a `stream.failed` webhook notification.

The error details can be extracted from the [stream components state](/api-reference/streams/stream-resource-impl/get-components). The response can look like this:
```json
{
    "streamId": "46df931a-3622-4c39-80fe-70d636e99ba5",
    "groupId": "46df931a-3622-4c39-80fe-70d636e99ba5",
    "state": "FAILED",
    "stateDescription": null,
    "stateChangedTimestamp": "2025-02-19T04:42:32.344Z",
    "gateway": {
        "state": "CLOSED",
        "stateChangedTimestamp": "2025-02-19T04:42:28.037Z"
    },
    "processors": [
        {
            "processorId": "transcriber",
            "state": "ERROR",
            "stateChangedTimestamp": "2025-02-19T04:42:32.328Z",
            "stateDescription": "External close signal received"
        },
        {
            "processorId": "diarization",
            "state": "ERROR",
            "stateChangedTimestamp": "2025-02-19T04:42:32.298Z",
            "stateDescription": "[InternalErrorName.GENERAL_INTERNAL_ERROR] JobFailedException: Job 5fb5614f-8959-409f-931f-3f9a4f233130-e1 failed with status FAILED: [Errno 1094995529] Invalid data found when processing input: ..."
        },
        {
            "processorId": "llm",
            "state": "COMPLETED",
            "stateChangedTimestamp": "2025-02-19T04:42:28.027Z",
            "stateDescription": "Stream has no prompt enabled"
        }
    ]
}
```

Here we can see that the `transcriber` and `diarization` processors are in the `ERROR` state. The `stateDescription` field provides additional information about the error.

The `External close signal received` message indicates that the processor was closed by either a cancel action from the user or from an automatic cancel due to other processor failure in the same pipeline.
