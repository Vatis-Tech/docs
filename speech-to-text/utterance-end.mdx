title: 'Utterance End'
description: 'Use the utterance end flag to detect the end of speech'
---

The Utterance End feature can be used to detect the end of speech by waiting a configured amount of milliseconds of silence after the last detected speech.

The end of speech is detected using a combination between the VAD (Voice Activity Detection) and the transcription model. The transcription model is also used to prevent false positives of speech detection by VAD.

## Configuration

The Utterance End feature can be configured by using the `utteranceEnd=1000` query parameter, where `1000` is the amount of milliseconds of silence to wait after the last detected speech.

## Result

When an utterance is ended, a [transcription response](/api-reference/schemas/egress/transcription-response) with the `"utterance": true` attribute is emitted. The content of the response can be a transcription response or an empty transcription, depending on the underlying engine implementation.
